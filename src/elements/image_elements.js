/**
 * Draw an image to the canvas.
 *
 * This element can be used with different numbers of attributes. The
 * simplest use requires only three attributes: img, x, and yâ€”where (x, y) is
 * the position of the image. Two more attributes can optionally be added to
 * specify the width and height of the image.
 *
 * This element can also be used with eight Number attributes. To
 * differentiate between all these attributes, p5.js uses the language of
 * "destination rectangle" (which corresponds to "dx", "dy", etc.) and "source
 * image" (which corresponds to "sx", "sy", etc.) below. Specifying the
 * "source image" dimensions can be useful when you want to display a
 * subsection of the source image instead of the whole thing.
 *
 * This element can also be used to draw images without distorting the original aspect ratio,
 * by adding 9th attribute, fit, which can either be COVER or CONTAIN.
 * CONTAIN, as the name suggests, contains the whole image within the specified destination box
 * without distorting the image ratio.
 * COVER covers the entire destination box.
